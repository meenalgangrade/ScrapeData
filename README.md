# ScrapeData
This application is used to scrape data from web.
It is a RESTful service.
To run the application:
1. server.js is the entry point.
2. To run type, "node server.js"
  As it is a POST request, therefore, I used postman to add url and check the response.
3. To run test cases, "npm run test"
